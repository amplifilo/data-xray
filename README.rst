Data-Xray
=============

Data-Xray provides a Pythonic interface to organization and analysis of
data, acquired primarily with Nanonis controllers, manufactured by Specs GmbH.

The primary emphasis at the moment is on scanning probe microscopy measurements,
but most of the analysis applies to other domains of hyperspectral data.

Data organization is achieved through the use of xarray structure (https://docs.xarray.dev) - which is 
an ingenious extension of Pandas phenomenology onto arbitrary dimensions.

Data-Xray draws upon many truly excellent python libraries, for which we as developers
are phenomenally greatful. 

Installation / Setup
********************

Please pip install directly from git 

pip install git+https://github.com/amplifilo/data-xray.git

**Testing**


Documentation
*************

Documentation is still in the making. Please consult notebooks in the examples folder
for specific workflows.

The general organization of Data-Xray is through workflow-specific modules:

data-xray.nanonisio for input from 3ds, sxm and dat files generated by Nanonis
data-xray.report for automated report generation functions
data-xray.grid for functions specific to hyperspectral grids
data-xray.scan for functions specific to images
data-xray.spectrum for functions specific to single spectra
data-xray.cluster for quick clustering functions (wrapped around scikit)
data-xray.viz for shared visualization functions

Updates to data-xray happen frequently, with likely breaks in code organization.
